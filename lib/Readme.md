Use board.json for sample input. Use that format when loading the game.

## Motivation

At PAX East 2014, the PowerPoint version of Jeopardy used for Game Show night vomited all the answers, so I thought that there has to be a better HTML5 version of this so that it works.

## Installation

Host on a website. Images should be located on the host server but referenced in the game JSON file.

## TODO

- Whatever Dan wants at this point.
